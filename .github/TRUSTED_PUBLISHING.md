# NuGet Trusted Publishing Setup

This repository uses [NuGet Trusted Publishing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/trusted-publishing) to securely publish packages to NuGet.org without managing long-lived API keys.

## How It Works

1. When the release workflow runs, GitHub Actions generates a short-lived OIDC token
2. The `dotnet nuget push` command automatically uses this token
3. NuGet.org validates the token and issues a temporary API key (valid for ~1 hour)
4. The package is published using the temporary key

## Configuration Required on NuGet.org

The repository owner must configure a Trusted Publishing policy on NuGet.org:

1. Log in to [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/)
2. Go to your account settings â†’ **Trusted Publishing**
3. Click **Add** to create a new trusted publishing policy
4. Fill in the policy details:
   - **Package ID**: `OasReader`
   - **Owner**: `christianhelle`
   - **Repository**: `oasreader`
   - **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## Workflow Configuration

The release workflow (`release.yml`) includes the required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # Required for OIDC token generation
  contents: write  # Required for creating tags
```

The push command no longer requires an API key:

```yaml
- name: Push packages to NuGet
  run: dotnet nuget push **/*.nupkg --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --no-symbols
```

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: No long-lived API keys to manage or rotate
- **Reduced Risk**: Credentials cannot be leaked or stolen
- **Simplified CI/CD**: No secrets to configure in GitHub repository settings
- **Audit Trail**: All publishing activity is tied to specific workflow runs
